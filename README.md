# Isaac-Leshy-s-Car-Service
Final Project for CIS-18A

Isaac & Leshy own a car service that helps people with various problems/requests for their cars. At the main menu you can select:

   1. Engine Repair
   2. Radio Repair
   3. Paint Job
   4. Tire Replacements
   5. Other Parts Replacements (Doors, Mirrors, Chairs, etc.)
   6. Improvements
   7. Refuel
   8. Other Type of Service

For each service, you fill out the required information pertaining to the service you selected. Some allow you to enter multiple parts. Others only allow a single input. And some allow you to not know exactly what needs to be repaired and that someone will come help anyway and figure it out for you.
After filling out the required information, you then enter your email & phone number.
Almost all services then have you enter details concerning the appointment, specifically date, time, and location. Very few services require that the company contacts you first in order to finalize details before you are allowed to make an appointment.
After everything is done, the information is output on a .txt file in the same folder as the package folders.

Included is my documentation paper on the program, along with pseudocode. The pseudocode is not exact to the program, as during the creation process, some changes were made to either save time or make improvements.
